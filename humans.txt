Yo bro. I’m in a bit of a pickle. I’m trying to give you a compliment right now but not sure what to say. Just know you’re kindof a big dill to me.


Let’s be like monkeys and hang later.


Have the best day ever, and if someone tries to ruin it for you, send me their name and I will yell at them.


Here’s a random text that you can use as an excuse to bail on someone who is boring to talk to today.


Loouuiiiissssssa, you dink .What are you doing tonight?


Hey, it’s me, the hotty you’re looking for.


Oh man. I just got my hair cut and now I look like the lesbian version of Tinkerbell. aka Twinkerbell.


Yeah that’s fine, just make sure to get rid of the body. Whoops, sorry wrong person, forget you saw that text.


Damn you’re annoyingly cute today. Not sure if I want to spank you for fun or for misbehaving.
